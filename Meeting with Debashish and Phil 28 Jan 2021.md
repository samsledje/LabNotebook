# Meeting 28 Jan 2021

- ABC transporters
- ADPase
- Model organism like [_Nematostella vectensis_](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5067631/)
- How do predicted regions of contact _in contact map_ compare with co-evolutionarily conserved regions?
- 60k predicted in cross-species -- unlikely to happen because they would have to cross 3 membranes, but potentially _could_ interact if in the same location -- coevolution and [evolutionary trace](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8609628/) is particularly helpful here
    - Identify _core_ evolutionary protein machinery that is conserved across the tree of life -- i.e. [heat shock protein](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/1/eabd4210)
- Investigate early history of eukaryotic evolution -- **ancient interactome** -- Eric Baptiste
- How do coral [recognize](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1462-5822.2006.00765.x) and [pick up](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22688813/) symbionts in the environment -- protein/sugar interactions, protein/protein interactions
- Predictions in [_M. capitata_](http://cyanophora.rutgers.edu/montipora/) and compare with RNA-seq co-expression **[Github](https://github.com/echille/Montipora_OA_Development_Timeseries/tree/master/RNAseq_Analyses)**

## Follow up with Rohit
- Predict PPI networks in 3 related coral species
- Align homologous proteins within those 3 species and see which interactions are maintained between homologous pairs
- Given a module -- how many PPIs are coexpressed in the RNA (compared to a random module of given size) -- get p-value for a module based on co-expression data
