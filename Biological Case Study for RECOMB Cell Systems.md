## Objectives:
- Less well-studied species from a network perspective
    - [[PPI in Malaria]]
    - [sheep](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24904168/)
    - [songbirds](https://europepmc.org/backend/ptpmcrender.fcgi?accid=PMC4359888&blobtype=pdf) suggested by Lenore
- Something where we can focused on _pathways_ and _modules_ rather than individual interactions
- Focus on _binding interactions_ not _regulatory interactions_

### To Do:

- Malaria databases - what ppi exists, what questions do we want to ask
- Rohit To Do: Look up cow rumen on google scholar, curate a list of 15-20 genes involved in cow digestion, run PPI on whole genome w/ rumen genes, tie back to [sheep rumen](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24904168/)
