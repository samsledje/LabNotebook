### Background
Bepler & Berger
TAPE
[[Kolodny_Protein_Interface_Similarity.pdf | PatchBag]]
Some network prediction references
Structure prediction references

### Research Plan
Investigate protein interaction from a structural perspective -- leverage advances in protein structure prediction / language modeling / deep neural networks to take a physical-structure motivated approach to predicting interaction networks

#### Current Status
- D-SCRIPT work up through RECOMB

#### Future Work
- Binding characterization work [[Research Tasks#Binding Pocket Characterization]]
- Network synthesis work [[Research Tasks#Network-Sequence Hybrid]]
- Applications in non-model species [[Research Tasks#Coral PPI Prediction]] [[PPI in Malaria]]

### Timeline

### Resources
- Compute resources provided by the Berger Lab
- Data available from the following sources:
    - Interaction data from STRING
    - Structural data from PDB, 3DID, Vreven Docking
