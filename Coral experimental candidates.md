## Experimental Validation High Level
get clusters that are involved with sensory perception in 3 networks, take pairs we predict and validate some
- pull out clusters with lokender's and hannah's proteins
- look at clusters in cytoscape and decide which ones to look at
- computational docking screen
- shortlist of experimental validation candidates
    - yeast two hybrid / co immuno-precipitation

### Candidates
TLRs, find interaction partners as homologs with human interactors of TLRs
Stimulate cell with signals and do qPCR

### GPCRs from Judith
Uniprot GPCR list?
