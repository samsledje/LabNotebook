Position Description:

Are you a machine learning / artificial intelligence data scientist passionate about working on compelling, real-world problems? At Mayo Clinic, our vision is to use data science and artificial intelligence to transform medicine and healthcare delivery into a data-driven and evidence- based discipline that is personalized for each individual patient. As the global expert in solving rare and complex disease, Mayo Clinic has a long history of excellence in healthcare and medical innovation. Ranked the number one research hospital in the nation by U.S. News and World Report, Mayo Clinic exists to solve the world’s most challenging medical problems, one patient at a time. The Mayo Clinic – Center for Individualized Medicine has initiated a unique and transformative data-driven research initiative to unlock features in genomic, transcriptomic, epigenetic, proteomic, microbiome and other omics data that will better predict patient outcomes and ultimately lead to improved patient care. Simultaneously, this initiative will create a data platform for large-scale multi-omics data integration and research. We are looking for talented data scientist interns to help implement this Omics Data Platform, integrate large bodies of heterogeneous data and enable advanced analytics including machine learning and artificial intelligence.

Candidates must have expertise in AI, machine learning, deep learning, statistical data processing, regression techniques, neural networks, decision trees, clustering, pattern recognition, probability theory and data science methods used to analyze data. This position provides the opportunity to:

Work with knowledge architects, informaticians and clinicians at Mayo Clinic, and partner outside companies to develop and deploy applications to bring AI and analytic solutions to nontechnical users, often at the point of care.

Apply and modify existing scripts or software applications to support data management, data extraction, data analysis, and AI as required.

Develop predictive models on datasets to address various clinical problems by leveraging statistical modeling, operations research, machine learning, or data mining techniques.

Provide consultative services to departments/divisions and/or support scientific projects under the guidance of a designated senior level data scientist.

Role & Responsibilities:

Interns will utilize statistics and computer science to solve complex problems in healthcare. Candidates will work with clinicians and scientists on many of the cutting-edge research areas within the Center for Individualized Medicine to extract value from data including:

Diagnostic predictive analytics projects involving image analysis, signal processing and pattern recognition.

Analysis of high-throughput genomic, transcriptomic, epigenetic, proteomic, microbiome and other omics data from healthy and disease cohorts.

Deployment of scalable deep learning approaches for biological modeling applications.

The data science intern will interact with vast amounts of clinical and non-clinical data (external data sources, digital, etc.). Interns will learn the data science lifecycle including data acquisition, transformation, data engineering, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, algorithm development, and algorithm deployment into a relevant clinical and/or business context. Interns are expected to help formulate analytical questions, perform hypothesis testing, algorithm optimization, algorithm deployment, and integrate feedback rapidly from stakeholders. Candidate needs to have an open mind and ability to take concepts developed by other industries and apply them to healthcare. Candidates should be effective communicators and good team players. Candidates who have coursework, projects, and evidence of interest in data science (e.g. participating in Kaggle competitions) but lack industry experience are ideal for this position.  

Qualifications:

Current enrollment or recent graduate of undergrad or grad program in: Computer Science, Information Technology, Engineering, Data Science, Physics, Statistics/Biostatistics, or other related field with strong quantitative analytical skills. School or project experience in applying data science approaches/tools. Proven written and oral communication skills are essential.  
AI experience/exposure or familiarity with AI principles is required. Courses and comfort level with at least one of the following: computer programming, machine learning, graph theory, algorithms, statistics, SQL and linear algebra are essential for success. Experience with major programming languages is beneficial. Demonstrated initiative/innovation in coursework and projects.
