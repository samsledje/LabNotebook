To whom it may concern:

My name is Sam and I'm a 2nd year PhD student at MIT, where my research focuses on protein interaction and structure prediction using deep learning and language modeling. I'm interested in the Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence co-op at Biogen to gain industry experience and experience working with other types of biomedical data beyond biomolecular data. My experience in computational biology in several research positions, in addition to experience with machine learning for health care data at Optum and laser communication and signal processing at MIT Lincoln Lab make me uniquely suited for this position.

I have worked extensively with machine learning models in Python and am excited for the opportunity to apply this knowledge towards audio signal classification. While I have previously worked towards understanding Alzheimer's disease using single cell molecular data, the Biogen ML/AI co-op provides the exciting opportunity to work towards understanding this disease from a new perspective. I believe I would be a strong fit for this position, which aligns with my personal goals for both professional development and scientific progress.

I look forward to hearing back about this position!
Cheers,
Sam
