Work Description @ MIT:
    
     - Developed a novel deep learning method for sequence-based prediction of protein interactions using structure-aware protein language models (Submitted to RECOMB 2021).
     - Currently working to expand this model with attention based mechanisms and apply a transfer learning framework to increase performance in non-model species.

        Previous Rotations:
    - Development of pipeline for using single-cell expression data to learn disease progression trajectories and regulatory pathways in neurodegenerative diseases.
    - Study of the impact of somatic mutational burden in Alzheimer's disease (Review and re-submit, Nature).
