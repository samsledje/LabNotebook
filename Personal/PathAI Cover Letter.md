Dear Michelle,

I am interested in applying for the Biomedical Data Scientist internship at PathAI. I am a computational biologist with several years of experience in machine learning and molecular biology. PathAI is looking for scientists who are passionate about principled science with strong translational impact, and I believe my experience and skill set make me a strong fit for this position where I could make an immediate contribution to PathAI's research goals.

I am a 2nd year Computer Science PhD student at MIT working under the direction of Dr. Bonnie Berger. My research focuses on protein interaction and structure prediction using deep learning and language modeling. In this research, I have worked extensively with development of machine learning models in Python using popular frameworks including Pytorch and Keras. I focused on developing a model that was robust, generalizable, and interpretable. My work is currently under review at RECOMB 2021, and have released an open-source software package.

During my first rotation in the laboratory of Dr. Manolis Kellis, I used single-cell RNA-seq data to analyze the impact of somatic mutational burden in Alzheimer's Dementia.  In this project, I performed single cell data analysis of differential gene expression in R. This work is currently under review and revision for Nature.

Put frankly, the culture and mission of PathAI excites me. PathAI combines a strong focus on both novel basic science and patient-focused translational research. The team is focused on principled science, ambitious problems, and impactful work. I have been following the company for over a year, and am excited to be in a position where I believe my research experiences and skills make me a highly suitable candidate for this internship.  I am enthusiastic to apply my computing and biology skills in this position, especially in the domains of biomarker discovery and disease detection, where computational results are directly translational to patient care.

I look forward to hearing from you about this position. I have attached my resume for additional information. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Samuel Sledzieski
