# A Novel Whole Genome Sequencing Based Assay for Chromosomal Aberration Detection In A Clinical Setting

## Abstract

**Copy number variations** (CNVs) are a major source of variations between individual humans and have been shown a key factor in many human diseases, including mental illness, developmental disorders, and cancer. A number of assays have been widely used in research and clinical laboratories for detection of CNVs, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), PCR-based assays, chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) and next-generation sequencing (NGS). Currently, CMA is suggested as a first-tier test for patients with unexplained developmental or intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorders, and congenital anomalies.

Over the past decade, the advancement of NGS technologies and computational tools for data analysis has brought unprecedented advances in DNA sequencing throughput, speed, and cost. NGS allows whole genome sequencing (WGS) to be a possibility for researchers in life sciences and healthcare. To explore the possibility of using WGS to replace the current CMA in the clinical laboratories, we developed a CNV calling algorithm for detecting large (>50Kb) deletions and duplications that are usually implicated to cause diseases. Preliminary results show the exceptional sensitivity and specificity of the newly developed tool and show the potential of WGS as a first-tier diagnostic assay that may replace CMA in clinic when paired with our tool. 

To promote the adoption and use of best practices of the newly developed tool in clinic, we seek a collaboration to develop a user-friendly graphic user interface (GUI) for pathologists. We also look for a system that could collect and curate CNVs and build a clinically relevant CNV database. A further project would be developing machine learning algorithms for linking CNVs with human diseases.
