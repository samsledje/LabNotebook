Dear Hiring Manager,

I am interested in applying for the Computational Biology, Human Target Validation Core co-op at Biogen. I am a computational biologist with several years of experience in machine learning and molecular biology. I believe my experience and skill set make me a strong fit for this position, where I could make an immediate contribution as well as develop my professional and research skills.

I am a 2nd year Computer Science PhD student at MIT working under the direction of Dr. Bonnie Berger. My research focuses on protein interaction and structure prediction using deep learning and language modeling. In this research, I have worked extensively with development of machine learning models in Python using popular frameworks including Pytorch and Keras. My work is currently under review at RECOMB 2021 and the model has been made publicly available as a software package release.

During my first rotation in the laboratory of Dr. Manolis Kellis, I used single-cell RNA-seq data to analyze the impact of somatic mutational burden in Alzheimer's Dementia.  In this project, I performed single cell data analysis in R and employed a strong working knowledge of HPC cluster use. This work is currently under review and revision for Nature.

The Biogen Computational Biology HTVC co-op provides the unique opportunity to combine my two research areas, by applying deep learning methods to analyze single-cell transcriptomic data for neurodegenerative diseases. I am enthusiastic to apply my computing and biology skills in this position, especially in the domain of drug discovery, where computational results have have direct translational impact.

In conclusion, I believe that my research experiences and skills make me a highly suitable candidate for the Computational Biology, HTVC co-op. 

I look forward to hearing from you about this position. I have attached my resume for additional information. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Samuel Sledzieski
