They players fight the soldiers, and should collect the keys used to wind them. There are two doors in the back of the room, which are opened by the two keys from the soldiers. It doesn't matter which key is used for which door. They then move up the staircases behind the doors to the second level.

Second Floor

If they go up the left staircase, they find a [[Clockwork Brawler]]. If they go up the right staircase, they find a [[Clockwork Mage]]. At the end of both rooms, there are levers with a keyhole next to them. The players must defeat both monsters and then use the key from the opposite room (i.e. Brawler key in right hole, Mage key in left hole) and both levers must be pulled at once. This opens up the wall between the two rooms and reveals a staircase up to the third floor. On the third floor is a short hallway, with two doors on the right and one the left

Dear Diary,

It's been a rough week. Inspector came in from Trafford and what do you know, we're not up to code. And we just ran the February numbers. I don't know how much longer we can survive with these profits. People just aren't buying clockwork like they used to, I guess. Times are... moving on. People are moving on...

6/18, 597

We just got a new shipment of parts in this morning. It may be our last for a while. Gildong is going to Trafford this evening to try to take out a loan, but you'd have to be out of your goddamned mind to give money to this sinking ship. I keep telling him we need to just let it go, give up. I've been talking with Jane about closing shop completely and moving into the city. Maybe try to find a craftsman job of some sort... I don't know

I'm convinced of it. Gildong has gone fucking crazy. I know that he thinks that magic shit could save the business, he knows how it works, but it creeps me the fuck out. These things are machines, I know how they work. I know why they work. I can put them together, and take them apart. I know how to get them to stop working...

10/23, 597

Happy birthday to me, I guess. It doesn't feel much like a birthday. Jane couldn't make it with work, but she's coming in from the city tomorrow. Gildong just stays locked in the fucking basement these days. Maybe some fresh air would do me some good...

Players discover Clockwork spies but kill them

Enter 1023 on pinpad to open up dumb waiter which leads down to the basement
