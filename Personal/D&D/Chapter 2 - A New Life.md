This is the groundhog day / Eleventh hour one

Nature themed

Villain is [[Yang]]

Why is she keeping them alive??

Some mutinous underling of Yang has stolen the brush and is keeping the heroes alive until they can fight her

# Basic Plot

- Animals have just attacked the city, but fled when Dian came to life and protected the city
- Willamir sees the animals which have just died reanimate and run into the forest
    - Willamir either returns willingly with or iis captured by Mythl and Tara and brought back to the mother tree
- Rest of the party (should) go after Willamir, track him to the camp where they see the tree with the yin/yang, and then finally back to a large pool with a waterfall
- Find a cave behind the waterfall
- Cave collapses behind them, trapping them inside
- Fight through and come to a giant cavern with a massive tree in the center
- They die, (are choked by vines when they step into the cavern) but reawaken at the beginning of the cave
- Something is keeping them alive

## Opening Cutscene - *A New Life*

*(0:13)* See this, and see it well, for every tale has a purpose. See the bear, as it lowers on its haunches, and she, with her white hair and golden eyes slides from his back. See the vines which twist and weave a crown upon her head and shoes upon her feet. See the brush which she pulls from her belt and see the canvas across which she draws it. We will leave her now, but her story is not yet complete.

*(0:40)* See this, and see it well, for every life has a meaning. See the broken windows and broken hearts, see them that lie dying in the fading light. See the ruined homes and ruined lives, and the hope that in time, they may rebuild, although never reclaim what was lost. We will leave them now, but their story is not yet complete.

*(1:05)* See this, and see it well, for every plight needs a hero. See the wizard, the rogue, and the ranger that stand in the shadow of gold. See the druid, standing frozen outside the city's bounds. Their story has only just begun.

*(1:23)* Hear this, and hear it well. Everything we have done or will do we will do over and over and over again, forever. All life that is, has been, and will again return.

*(1:38)* See this, and see it well, for every death has a story. See the fallen, the birds and beasts that ring the walls. See them as they rise and return again to the forest from whence they came. See that wind that comes and breathes into them a new life. *(End)*
