# Boomerang of Retreiving

Cost: 50
Description: This magic boomerang deals 1d6+1 force damage to any target it hits, inflicted by the faint magical field of force surrounding the weapon. Unlike a normal boomerang, the boomerang of retrieval will always return to you after you make a ranged attack with it, even if you hit. If after thrown this boomerang hits a small unattended object weighting no more than 1 pound and occupying space no more than 1 cubic foot, it will magically carry that object back with it to your space.
