# Chapter 3 - Time's Arrow

## Mind If I Cut In? - Opener:

(0:41) In every crisis, the one constant is noise.

In every emergency, every catastrophe, every time in the past that you've had to run, or flee, or hide, or fight, every time your life has been on the line, you have been faced with the inescapable torrent of sound.

(1:13) The sounds of steel against steel, and fist against flesh. The twang of bowstrings, and the whistle of arrows flying through the air, landing in chain or leather. That indescribable but unmistakable sound of magic, manifest. 

The sounds of fear, and of pain. Screaming. Panicking. Children crying, dogs barking, horses galloping frantically. The crackle of fire as it consumes everything in its path, or the rush of water as it suffocates the landscape. The sickening thud of bodies falling lifeless to the dirt.

But when you wake up this morning, you hear (2:05) silence.

It is not the silence of sleep, that peaceful quiet of crickets chirping, of a warm breeze blowing, and the light breaking of twigs underfoot as the watchman keeps his vigil.

(2:21) It is not a magical silence, the imposition of will which leaves the faintest ringing in your ears, blocking any sound from reaching them and binding the lips of any caught in its wake.

(2:37) It is not the silence of death, that perverse, sticky, irony silence, that absence of sound punctuated only by the scrape of spades against earth, the screeching of vultures circling overhead, and the mournful cry of a widow.

(3:10) When you wake up this morning, you hear something new. For the first time in any of your lives, you hear pure, raw, unadulterated, silence. (3:27) Nothingness.

What do you want to do?
