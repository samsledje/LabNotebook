## Opening Cut Scene - Sanctuary of the Order - *Garden of Zeus*

Peace has never been something familiar to you, but for a moment, you feel it. In a nation of troubles, of war, of disease, and of poverty, a moments respite can be hard to find. But here, in the Garden of Dian, you each forget all of that for just a moment. *(0:21)* The sun shines, glinting off the pool in the center of the garden and casting a shimmer of waving light that dances across your faces. A light breeze passes through, carrying on it the scent of flowers and the sounds of birds singing. *(0:38)* Children play, a rare sight in days such as these, rolling in the grass under Dian's watchful stone gaze. As you glance around, you see a lone bird alight on one upturned palm of the statue, then dance over to the other closed hand, before taking off into the sky again. You see a dog bound across the grass and leap into the pile of children, whose laughter fills the air. You see a gardener tending to the flowers, carefully trimming each and every leaf and stem. *(1:10)* Take in this moment, inhale it, internalize it, feel it, remember it. Moments like these don't come nearly often enough, and they don't last nearly long enough. *End*

Your eyes settle on the entrance to the garden, where an old Elvish man stands, holding in his hand a loosely rolled scroll. You recognize this man as [[Armand]], your mentor and head of the [[Black Oath Information Society]], the organization to which you all belong.
