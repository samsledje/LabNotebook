## Backstory

Swinghard Bighit-Jones was born to Twistbone Bighit, second in command of the Bighit orc tribe and visiting scientist Arthur Jones. When Swinghard was just a baby, his father Arthur fled the clan village to a nearby city during a particularly violent change of power that left Twistbone dead.

Raised in the human world, Swinghard was always mocked by his peers for being bigger, dumber, and uglier than the other children. He grew to resent his father for taking him from the orc tribe, where he was certain he would fit in, and be accepted.

As an adolescent, Swinghard's anger with his father boiled over and he ran from home. Left to live among the streets, he learned to provide for himself and still finds that trust does not come easily. He secured various odd jobs, eventually settling into a job as a blacksmith where his natural strength, if not wits, left him capable for the job. Through these years, he picked up a number of scars, from hot irons and street brawls equally. His blacksmith mentor, Armand Hammer, became like a father to him.

As he grew older, he learned to keep his anger in check, and is seeking a better life for himself. He still feels the taunts from his childhood, and the need to prove that he is fit for the world of man. He hopes to reconnect with his true father Arthur and make up for lost time, and to connect for the first time with his orc roots. Although his rage still occasionally boils over, he has learned to channel it to protect those he cares about.
