# Background

The body of the proposal must be well organized and phrased in good English, but the specific arrangement and details of coverage can vary depending on the problem, your preferences, and those of your research supervisor. Each proposal, however, should include at least the following topics.
- A brief summary of the background of the problem up to the present must be included giving evidence by reference or otherwise that you have become familiar with this background. In discussing the present status of the problem, you should make evident the extent to which the proposed solution is novel and/or an improvement.
- The probable procedure must be outlined -- from start to finish -- showing which steps are doubtful and therefore subject to change. Include a time schedule that either specifies dates by which various parts of the work should be completed or else allocates a certain number of hours to each major part of the thesis task, such as preparation of samples, experimental work and analysis, correlation and interpretation of results, and preparation of the report. (The total number of hours assigned to a Master's or EE/ECS thesis is nominally 360 hours.)
- A list of the principal equipment and facilities needs must be included, together with the places, which will supply these needs. You should have some assurance that what you need will be available at the time desired. For non-experimental theses, the sources of data (if any) must be stated and the availability of the data assured.
- A bibliography must be included
