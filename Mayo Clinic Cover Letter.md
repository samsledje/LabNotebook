Dear Dr. Kalantari,

I am interested in applying for the data scientist internship position for the Omics Data Platform. I am a computational biologist with several years of experience in AI and machine learning, biology and health data analysis, and software engineering . I believe my experience and skill set make me a strong fit for this position, where I could make an immediate contribution as well as develop my professional and research skills.

I am a 2nd year Computer Science PhD student at MIT working under the direction of Dr. Bonnie Berger. My research focuses on protein interaction and structure prediction using deep learning and language modeling. In this research, I have worked extensively with development of machine learning models in Python using popular frameworks including Pytorch and Keras. My work is currently under review at RECOMB 2021 and the model has been made publicly available as a software package release.

During my first rotation in the laboratory of Dr. Manolis Kellis, I used single-cell RNA-seq data to analyze the impact of somatic mutational burden in Alzheimer's Dementia.  In this project, I performed single cell data analysis in R and built data processing pipelines for transcriptomic data. This work is currently under review and revision for Nature.

I also have several years of experience as a software engineer, working on larger-scale data processing and platform design tasks. For a senior design project with the Jackson Laboratory, I worked on an online platform for CNV discovery from genomic data, and at Optum Technology I worked on a team developing machine learning algorithms for health care data. I have worked on both ends of the spectrum, from predictive algorithm development to data engineering and deployment.

As a data science intern for the Omics Data Platform at the Mayo Clinic, I could combine my experience in both deep learning, data science, and transcriptomic analysis to help analyze the wealth of multi-omic data available. I am enthusiastic to apply my computing and biology skills in this position, and to work through the entire process to fully enable the type of analytics required by modern health care practitioners.

In conclusion, I believe that my research experiences and skills make me a highly suitable candidate for the Omics Data Platform internship.. 

I look forward to hearing from you about this position. I have attached my CV for additional information. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Samuel Sledzieski
