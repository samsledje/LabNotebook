---

Nucleotide mutations shared by ≥3 samples becomes phylogenetically informative feature

Triplet methods

Maximize consistency between partitions

No reads ≠ ancestral type → Yes / No / No evidence

Intersect variant calls with all reads

Induce partitions on yes/no and look for nested partitions
