# Fluoresence
_Liza Roger_

- Linked to [[Toll-Like Receptors]] and Immune response
- Photoprotection, photoinhibition, symbiodinium signaling, larvae settlemen and dispersal, thermal stress
- Fluorescent response

- Re-do in P.acuta, M.capitata
- Search GFP vs. all and look at likelihood of GFP interacting with immune response protein vs. background set
- For each GFP -- what are the GO terms in its (1/2 hop) neighborhood in IMMUNE 
    - Union of immediate neighbors of all GFP proteins
    - Subset of GO terms which is neighbors of BOTH GFP and TLR
- For each GFP -- what are the GO terms in its (1/2 hop) neighborhood in FULL
- Send list of GFP candidates in Pdam (with sequences) 
    - Lower priority: pdam_00015345-RA
    - Throw this one out: pdam_00015351-RA
- Repeat all with TLR
