# Inter-Protein Contacts with Attention

- [[D-SCRIPT v2 Research]]
- [[D-SCRIPT v2 Issues]]

## Notes
- Attention
- Interface / PatchBag
- MSA

Idea: use trRosetta as input to have CLEAR structure of each protein

Potential Architecture -- Use the standard transformer architecture to go from sequence --> sequence, and then take the shannon entropy of the attention map as "pooling" step to go to supervision
