## Assays
- Direct interaction
    - in situ confocal -- physically probe location of proteins to see if they are near each other
    - co-immunoprecipitation
    - Shotgun before targeted
    - Throughput - 1-5 to start, then scale up
- Indirect interaction - RNA-seq
    - We can have "as many as we want"
- Inhibitors/CRISPR/RNA-seq
    - Knock out something we think interacts and get a phenotype
    - If we have specificity for inhibitors, we can check inhibitors of different genes to see if pathway is affected
    - CRISPR is more direct but sirtuin inhibitors could be running more easily
- Functional predictions:
    - ex. Coral with give a bleaching response to menthol, light, temperature -- testing Trp, have control & different stressors, phenotypic and cell count bleaching response, RNA seq response of individual genes
    - What are strongest differentially expresed proteins --> these give us _candidates_ and then we can see if interactions are between candidates
- We can _propose_ a phenotypic response for a _gene of interest_ and then test that response

## Genes
- [sirtuins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirtuin) - epigenetic modification
    - Inhibitor, narrow range of concentrations and it inhibits certain specific enzyme activities
- [Ferredoxin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferredoxin) - electron donors for antioxidant scavengers
    - Main electron sink is superoxide dismutase - ROS scavenging, more oxidative stress, measure rates of photosynthesis, amount of ROS in tissues



## Pathways
Hubs of cellular metabolism with iron requirements
Invertebrates/cultured algae


## Colabs
- [Debashish Bhattacharya](https://bhattacharyalab.com/) holobiont integration, network based approaches, rna seq and metabolomics under stressor conditions --> modules associated with stressors
- Phil coral carnegie johns hopkins aptasia
