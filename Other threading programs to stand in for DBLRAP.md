# Other threading programs to stand in for DBLRAP

This recent paper is a meta-method, incorporating 9 existing state of the art existing threaders that the authors claim they were able to get successfully running on their internal machines. Let's use it as an index and check out the component threader softwares, and see if we can find 1-2 that perform well, are easy to install and easy to use in place of Raptor.
