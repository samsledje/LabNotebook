- Test datasets with random forest, knn, support vector machines, linear regression

- "Identity" is actually a _very_ small fully connected layer -- single trainable weight and bias
- 3 dense layers instead of 2 depicted in figure (probably not a huge deal??)
- More details on specific architecture used in this paper -- layer sizes, fully connected layers, etc.
