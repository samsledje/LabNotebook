## Assays
Yeast 2 Hybrid Screen - Direct validation of interactions
Overall goal -- molecular -> reef understanding
Judith - NOT knockout
CRISPR is hard in coral
Perturbation at reef level is important
Transient interaction -- can add but also wash away
Some cell types may not be easily accessible
Add ligands to easily accessible receptors and test phenotype
Easier to express protein ligands than receptors
Stain all proteins from Pdam with calcium-binding dye
Separate coral cells from symbiont cells - compare dying for coral with and without alge
Co-purification -- identify some negatively charged proteins and see what are bound to them
Link between uptake of Sr/Mg instead of Ca and structure/composition of coral
Delivery of protein to a certain location could be difficult
Attach proteins to bead, flow through a column, pull out everything bound to it and identify binding partners with mass spec

## Genes
Sensors, surface receptors -- find cell types where receptors are accessible
E coli has human-like insulin, maybe coral or bacteria will as well
Small, easy to handle secreted proteins
Highly negatively charged proteins - involved in biomineralization
Calcium binding proteins -- what do they interact with? Calcium buffering for reasons other than biomineralization?
Fetal bovine serum - serium oxide, ceria
    Transferrin, albumin
Given set of human genes that interact with nanoparticles -- what interactions do coral homologoues of human genes have? [Protein Corona Modules](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/689590)
Anything linking Sr/Mg binding proteins to calcification proteins --> could be controlling vital effect for elements

## Pathways
Ligands are provided by microbiome rather than PDam
    Insulin, somatistatic, glucagons provided by bacterial species
    Have the fungi/bacteriophages been sequenced? They have been identified as distinct species, but may not have been sequenced
Any "human like" signaling molecules provided by microbiome and not by coral species  -- or provided by coral, but pathways interfered with by microbiome
Predictions of metabolites would be great
Biomineralization
Cell culture
Proteins that absorb to surface of particle drive interaction with cell -- are these proteins losely or strongly bound proteins
What is stimulating growth?
